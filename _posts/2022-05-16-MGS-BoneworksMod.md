Gamedev wasn't something new to me when starting this project. I already had some experience but only using game maker. I wanted to step up but wasn't sure on how to proceed. 

While seeing the Boneworks modding scene, I thought it would be a nice first approach of the engine.
Retrospectively, I'm not convinced it was the best entry point on a technical point of view. But on a motivational one, it clearly was. I wanted to experiment the game Metal Gear Solid in VR so bad that I crunched my way through Unity to make it happen, learning a ton on the engine workflow along the way. This mod is still a blast to play today. I intend to port it into Bonelab once they'll release their official modding SDK.

A lot of care was taken on the lighting and overal atmosphere of this mod to match the original aesthetic the best I could.

The elevator, surveillance cameras, alert mod of npcs and rifle cameras logic was a lot of fun to work on and allowed me to understand how things interacted inside Unity.
