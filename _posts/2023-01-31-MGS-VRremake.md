After my initial work on Boneworks modding, I figured I should be able to reproduce a few game mechanics from metal gear solid 1 and transpose them in VR.
This was my real entry point into Unity VR dev allowing me to discover the engine in depth.

This allowed me to train on AI & inventory systems, animation, lighting, 3D modeling, texturing, save & load systems, VR interactions, debugging.
