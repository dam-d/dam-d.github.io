I started this project with the idea of linking the Bike Binder software I previously made into Descenders to physically control the game from a bike trainer. The lack of time prevented me from doing that final step but the VR mod in itself is entirely functional and a load of fun with a standard gamepad.

    <p>All original camera positions were kept intact allowing to play in 1st and 3rd person.</p>

This was my first VR injection project. Heavily relying on DnSpy and Bepinex. DnSpy allowed me to read and analyse the source code of the game while Bepinex was used to hook into existing methods and inject my own.

    <p>This mod requires strong VR legs. Don't try the 1st person view if you're sensitive to motion sickness.</p>
