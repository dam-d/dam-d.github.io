Virtual Reality is highly useful for real-life training due to its immersive learning environment, safety benefits, repeatability of scenarios, cost-effectiveness, customization, instant feedback, and its ability to overcome physical limitations. It offers a safe space for learners to practice and learn from mistakes. While it's not suitable for all training needs, VR has the potential to enhance training across various industries.

Physic of the vehicle as well as the loads it'll operate is an important part of the simulation, allowing the user to understand the risks involved in operating a forklift.

VR comfort is a crucial point for users. A vignette toggleable vignette settings helps preventing motion sickness in most cases.
