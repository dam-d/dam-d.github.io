Following my Descenders VR mod, here's another one for AudioSurf 2, kindly requested by an absolute fan of this game desperately looking for a proper VR implementation since 2017. This wish is now granted.

<div class="video-container">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/assets/img/loading.gif" src="/assets/img/videos/AudioSurf2VR.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="auto"></video>
</div>

As for Descenders, intensive use of DnSpy was made to analyze the game's code and structure. This mod also relies on Bepinex, a powerful modding framework for Unity allowing to hook into existing methods and inject our own code at runtime.
